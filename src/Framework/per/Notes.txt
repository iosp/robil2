--The Perception Package--

-Updated 25 Jun 2014

Implemented Features:
1. Build a height map from the data that arrives from the IBEO, SICK and FLEA sensors.
2. Publish a map and a mini-map with obstacle information and road types.
3. Provide a visualization tool for everything

Problems and unimplemented things:
1. Stereo vision is not used for mapping due to the poor performance of the stereo matching algorithm, until a new algorithm is found.


How to use visualization tool:
Once the framework is running, open a terminal and enter this:

    rostopic pub /PER/VISUAL std_msgs/Char "data: <MASK HERE>" 

where '<MASK HERE>'  is to be replaced with your selection of items to visualize. Flags are as follows:

#define VISUALIZE_NONE		0
#define VISUALIZE_MAP		1
#define VISUALIZE_MINIMAP 	2
#define VISUALIZE_STEREO	4
#define VISUALIZE_TYPES		8
#define VISUALIZE_FULLMAP	16

You may replace '<MASK HERE>' with any of the above numbers. You may also do a bitwise OR between the numbers to open several
visualization windows. The number that causes everything to displayed is 255.
