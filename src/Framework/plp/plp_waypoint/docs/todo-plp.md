# Questions
* What's the semantics of the path published at /PP/Path? it does not change during the task execution.
  - Specifically, how can we know how much path remains (that's needed for monitoring.)
  - See files `Path case study.xxx`
* How can we detect that a task has finished (e.g. arrived at the point?)
