What's new:
===========
1. Fixed negative speeds bug , 
2. Working with supporter position commands from WSM.
3. Verified Standby mode Implementation. 

Tests:
=============
In order to test our LLC node, please take these follwing steps:

1. Run the Gazebo Simulation - In *any* world enviorment.
2. Run robil2conf frameworkInit.launch 
3. Make sure that RateToEffort node is alive and running via "rqt_graph".
4. Pull the model's Loader by publishing [1,0,0] to the topic:
	WSM/BladePosition/position/[1,0,0]	
5. Publish a referenced speed with the Topic "WPD/velocity" - a good reasonable speed is between 0 - 2 (in magnitude).

5. Publish a referenced speed with the Topic "WPD/velocity" - a good reasonable speed is between 0 - 2 (in magnitude).

=========================
1. We checked the bobcat's functioning @ testTerrian world, available in 'live_bobcat' package.
2. If you wish to use Teleoperation for manual driving, please change the LLC node to standby mode.

What's new:
===========
1. Functioning PID controller over anglular speed along vessel's Z axis.
2. Updated the controller's convergance time.

Tests:
=============
In order to test our LLC node, please take these follwing steps:

1. Run the Gazebo Simulation - In empty world enviorment.
2. Run robil2conf frameworkInit.launch 
3. Make sure that RateToEffort node is alive and running via "rqt_graph".
4. Pull the model's Loader by publishing 1 to the topic:
	/Sahar/supporter_position_controller/command	
5. Publish a referenced speed with the Topic "WPD/velocity" - a good reasonable speed is between 0 - 2 (in magnitude).

=========================
1. Currently, we tested the controllor only on an empty world . 
2. If you wish to use Teleoperation for manual driving, please change the LLC node to standby mode.

What's new:
===========
1. Functioning PID controller over linear speed along vessel's X axis.
2. correct inputs from gazebo simulator.

Module Implemented Functionality:
===============
Velocity PID controller.

Interfaces changed:
=========
NONE

Tests:
=============

5. Publish a referenced speed with the Topic "WPD/velocity" - a good reasonable speed is between 0 - 2 (in magnitude).

Known Bugs and Limitations:
=========================
1. At the moment, Velocity controller over Angular speed along Z axis isn't fully functioning - 
   Therefore, this feature is unavilable at the moment. It will be by Thursday (22.05.14).
2. If you wish to use Teleoperation for manual driving, please move the LLC node to standby mode.
