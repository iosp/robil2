Localization module - version 2.1
---------------------------------

This module gets as an input data from GPS/INS, visual odometry and other inputs.
The module outputs the location of the bobcat with relation to the starting point of the bobcat as well as the speed of the bobcat.

In order to run the framework run:

	$ roslaunch robil2conf frameworkInit.launch

The launch will run all of the modules in the framework. They are all required.

once you run all of the modules you can subscribe to the LOC topics

	$ rostopic echo /LOC/Pose
	$ rostopic echo /LOC/Velocity


You should edit the userHeader.h file which is located at Framework/Loc/src/component folder.
There you can decide if you wish to work with or without system noise.
In addition, if you wish to work with noise you will have to uncomment the model.sdf file of the gps_ins folder which is located at
~/.gazebo/models/GPS_INS/model.sdf

<!--<noise>
	<gps>2.5</gps>
	<rollpitch>0.2</rollpitch>
	<yaw>0.8</yaw>
	<acc_bias>0.0005886</acc_bias>
	<gyro_bias>0.000833333</gyro_bias>
	<acc_noise>0.000465329</acc_noise>
	<gyro_noise>0.000252982</gyro_noise>
      </noise>-->
      
 remove the starting and ending <!-- ...... --> to add the noise.

Testing
-------
You can test the Localization by running,
python WORKSPACE/src/Framework/loc/test/graph_tracker.py

Press 3 - to get the defualt 2 graphs of location (x and y) and speed (x and y).
The graphs consists of the estimated position (in green) and the real position (in blue).

In case the real location is biased from the estimation, you can add this bias by pressing 4.
	

TODO
----
Add thread for the estimation process.
Add GPS speed data to estimation.
Add bobcat input to the estimation.
Add visual odometry.
