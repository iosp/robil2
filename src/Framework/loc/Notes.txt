Localization module
-------------------

This module gets as an input data from GPS/INS, visual odometry and other inputs.
The module outputs the location of the bobcat with relation to the starting point of the bobcat.

In order to run the framework do:

	$ roslaunch robil2conf frameworkInit.launch

The launch will run all of the modules in the framework. They are all required.
You will see alot of gibrish in the terminal... it's OK.

once you run all of the modules you can subscribe to the LOC topics

	$ rostopic echo /LOC/Pose
	$ rostopic echo /LOC/Velocity


NOTE - For now the module is 100% accurate since there are is no noise.
	
TODO
----

add tests.
Add Noise to sensors and implement KF.
