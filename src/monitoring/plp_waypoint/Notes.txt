# Waypoint PLP
This package contains the waypoint PLP - the PLP responsible for predicting the result of navigating the Bobcat through a planned path.

## Running the node
Command to run the node:

    rosrun plp_waypoint PlpWaypointRosHarness.py

The ros node takes a few optional parameters:

-monitor: on trigger, create a PLP to monitor the system (default behavior)
-capture: on trigger, dump the parameters to a file. Filename is passed as the following argument.

Examples:

    rosrun plp_waypoint PlpWaypointRosHarness.py
    rosrun plp_waypoint PlpWaypointRosHarness.py -monitor
    rosrun plp_waypoint PlpWaypointRosHarness.py -capture my-capture-file-name
    rosrun plp_waypoint PlpWaypointRosHarness.py -capture my-capture-file-name -monitor

The node will listen to the proper topics, and issue a prediction on the first time a planned path is published, once a navigation task has become active. The prediction is sent to topic `plp/messages`.
